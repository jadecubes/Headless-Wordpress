## Why Headless WordPress?

- **Decoupled Architecture** - Use WordPress solely as a content management backend via REST API
- **Modern Frontend** - Build with React and modern JavaScript frameworks for optimal performance
- **Scalability** - Scale frontend and backend independently based on your needs
- **Developer Experience** - Local development environment with Docker, HTTPS, and observability tools included
- **Flexibility** - Complete control over your frontend while leveraging WordPress's powerful content management

---

## Features

✨ **Complete Docker Setup** - Pre-configured Docker Compose with all services
🔒 **HTTPS in Development** - Local SSL certificates using mkcert
📊 **Observability Stack** - Integrated Grafana, Loki, and Promtail for monitoring
🔄 **Reverse Proxy** - Nginx reverse proxy with separate admin and API endpoints
🗄️ **Database Management** - Adminer included for easy database access
🚀 **Production-Ready** - Architecture designed for easy deployment to production

---

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed
- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) for local SSL certificates (optional, certs included)
- Make utility (usually pre-installed on Mac/Linux)

---

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

```bash
# Build the Docker images
make dev-build

# Start all services
make dev-up

# Stop all services
make dev-down
```

### Access Points

Once started, you can access:

- **Admin Portal**: https://admin.mycompany.local:8443
- **REST API**: https://api.mycompany.local:8443/wp-json
- **Frontend**: https://mycompany.local:8443 (proxied to localhost:3000 in dev)
- **Direct WordPress**: http://localhost:8080
- **Adminer (DB GUI)**: http://localhost:9091
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3001

## Who is Which
- https://admin.mycompany.local:8443 → always show the WP login/admin (no public site)
- https://api.mycompany.local:8443 → WP REST API only
- https://mycompany.local:8443 → React front-end (proxied to localhost:3000 in dev)


## Notes
- Certificate and key are generated by mkcert
  ```bash
  mkcert \
  -cert-file reverse-proxy/certs/certs/api.crt \
  -key-file  reverse-proxy/certs/private/api.key \
  "api.mycompany.local" "admin.mycompany.local" "localhost" "127.0.0.1" "::1"
  ```
- It's the development environment included in the repository.
